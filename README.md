# Neovim Config

Real-world config under 100 lines of code. This is not a demo. I use it for
my daily programming in large codebases. Everything is in a single lua file:
[init.lua](init.lua). My workflow includes:

- Treesitter: install parsers, syntax highlighting, etc.
- LSPs: completions, refactorings, formatting, etc.
- Project-wide search (I use :grep)
- Project-wide search for files (I use :find)
- Git, but I just use it from command-line
- File Explorer with buffer-like editor
- Project Settings (per-project-crafted lua file)
- Track my time with [wakatime](https://wakatime.com)
- Use [my own colorscheme](https://github.com/y9san9/y9nika.nvim)
- Multi-project workflow using ghostty

It was created by me for me. I am glad to answer questions tho. Feel free to
create issues.
